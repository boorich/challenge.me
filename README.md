# challenge.me
ethereum based global challenge for good

Challenge.me is let's you set a single goal and back it up by some ETH to achieve it. In case someone else thinks he or she can achievee your set goal better, your will be challenged and the community decides who is going to continue working towards that goal.

The challenging mechanism is easy. Anyone who is willing to challenge you deposits a security bond exactly matching your amount and the outcome of the community vote decides who is going to be eligible to the entire amount after the voting process.
