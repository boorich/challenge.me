# challenge.me
An ethereum-based global challenge for good

Challenge.me let's you set a single goal phrased in less then 200 characters. (Somewhat like Twitter) and back it up by some ETH that can be spent to achieve it. In case someone else thinks he or she can achieve your set goal better, your will be challenged and the community decides who is going to continue working towards that goal.

Any goal can be challenged at any time unless it is currently challenged.

# challenging
The challenging mechanism is easy. Anyone who is willing to challenge you deposits a security bond exactly matching your amount currently staked for that goal and the outcome of the community vote decides who is going to be eligible to the entire amount staked after the voting process.

# voting
Voting costs Eth. There is no minimum nor maximum.

Payable voting serves to purposes:
* weight the voting power of each vote directly proportional to all votes
* bring in fresh funds to achieve a goal (imagine fundraising and voting combined)

In theory this mechanism works against large accumulation of funds and grants the power to execute actions towards a set goal to the person most determined and capable to achieve it.
